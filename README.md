Search Profiles

Use the search bar to filter profiles in real-time.

Matching profiles are visually highlighted in the 3D scene.

Click and drag to rotate the chessboard.

Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

Hover over a pawn to see the profile name.

View Profile Details

Click on a pawn to open a detailed profile card.

Access LinkedIn and portfolio links directly from the card.

Customization
You can customize the application by:

Editing colors and themes via Tailwind CSS

Adding new profiles in employees.ts

AI Search Engine Concept
The system features an intelligent search engine for profile matching, including:

Real-time keyword-based filtering (name, skills, bio)

Semantic ("fuzzy") search with vectorization techniques

Note: Planned gamified features (such as chess pawn movement and puzzle unlocking) were not fully implemented due to hackathon time constraints.
